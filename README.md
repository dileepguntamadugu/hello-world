Understanding GIT better

This is just another text file. I feel like a writer whenever I type something that is useless.

Now, look at me I came to the State Library of NSW to just learn about GIT since I did not find any better place to learn it. There is a lot for me to learn. For now let me stop this typing mess and concentrate on the GIT learning process.

Until the next write up. Bye-Bye. Good Bye.
